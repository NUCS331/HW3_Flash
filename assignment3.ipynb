    "We assume that the scene is very dim. Hence, the image without the flash will have the lighting and color characteristics you want, but it will be noisy. The image with the flash will have incorrect lighting (i.e., the colors are off), but it will be much less noisy. You will write a program to denoise the no-flash image and then transfer detail from the flash image. The original paper proposes methods to compensate for highlights and shadows caused by the flash as well as color corrections, but you will not need to implement this.\n",

    "- I assume that you know a little bit about Deep Learning: What if you learn a CNN-style network to do a similar task (edge-preserving-filter). Do you think this could work? If yes, can you explain? If you've never heard of the bilateral filter, did you find other edge-preserving filters on google? If yes, can you tell us what the main idea is?
